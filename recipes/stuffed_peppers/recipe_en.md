# Description

We found these during Happy Hour at Chiso’s Grill in Bee Cave, Tx. We’ve since tweaked the recipe a bit. This recipe is just a starting point, add/remove anything you want (like more hot sauce if you’re into that). Sometimes I order the peppers on Amazon. My favorite hot sauces are Franks Red Hot, Jardine’s Texas Champagne, and of course, Yellowbird.

Fun fact: Peppedew Peppers are basically a new thing. They are the brand name of piquante peppers, which were discovered in South Africe in just 1993. Hat tip to Wikipedia for the schooling.

# Ingredients

* 1 jar Peppedew Peppers (or piquante pepper)
* 4oz goat cheese (any flavor)
* 1 tbsp mayonnaise
* 1 tbsp sour cream
* 1 bunch of chives, chopped
* hearty shot of hot sauce (Franks, Yellowbird)
* hearty crack of pepper

# Steps

1. combine goat cheese, mayo, sour cream, 2/3rds of your chives, hot sauce, black pepper
2. if you are feeling spry, beat the mixture to make it fluffy
3. put filling in a plastic bag, snip of the tip with scissors to make a piping bag
4. fill peppers, place in bowl, top with chives and hot sauce
