# Description

From a weird Sunday morning when I realized we didn’t have bread. Solid hitter. Served with Treehive Syrup, my new favorite breakfast obsession (it’s mixed with honey, vanilla, and cinnamon, oof).

# Ingredients

* 4 eggs
* 1/4 cup heavy cream
* 2 tsp vanilla
* sprinkle of sugar
* 4 cups Nilla Wafers Minis

# Steps

1. Beat the eggs, heavy cream, vanilla, and sugar.
2. Arrange the nillas in a few flat layers in a baking dish.
3. Pour egg mixture over nillas. Let soak while oven preheats to 350°. Top with shake of cinnamon sugar.
4. Bake until egg has set (it’ll fluff up a bit)
