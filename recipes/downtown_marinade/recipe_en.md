# Description

This is my go-to marinade for everything from steaks to shrimp to fajitas to pork. Seriously, if I’m cooking or grilling meat, there’s a good chance this is what it’s soaking in. It’s perfect for “street meat” aka cart or truck, like tacos and wraps and kebabs and skewers and everything in between. Start with this base, add spice or herb as desired.

# Ingredients

* 1 cup Italian dressing
* 1/4 cup soy sauce
* 1/4 cup chili paste (like sambal oelek)
* 1/4 sugar
* dash hot sauce (like Texas Champagne or Yellowbird)

# Steps

1. Mix everything in a large zip bag (or bowl)
2. Toss meat and let sit (from 1-36hr)
