# Description:

Bruschetta is an antipasto (starter dish) from Italy consisting of grilled bread, garlic and topped with olive oil.

# Ingredients:

* 5 tomatoes
* 1 ciabatta bread ( or just a baguette)
* Handful of fresh basilicum
* 2 cloves of garlic
* Some olive oil
* Pinch of black pepper

# Steps:

1. Fill a bowl with hot water. Snijd met een mes een kruis aan de onderkant van de tomaten.
2. Put the tomatoes in the water for around 1 minute and rinse them with cold water.
3. It should now be easy to peel of the skin of the tomato. Remove it.
4. Cut the part with the seeds out and throw it away. Cut the rest of tomato in pieces.
5. Put the pieces of tomato in a bowl and add a bit of olive oil.
6. Chop the basil and garlic into small pieces and add them to the tomato bowl.
7. Add a bit of pepper to the bowl.
8. Cover the bowl and let it marinate for at least 2 hours in the fridge (All night is fine too).
9. Cut the bread in slices and add a bit of olive oil to both sides of the bread.
10. Grill the bread in a pan or the oven until it is crunchy.
11. Remove the garlic from the bowl and divide the bowl over the slices of bread.
12. Do you like a strong garlic flavour? Just keep the garlic in the bowl.
