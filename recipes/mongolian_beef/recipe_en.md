# Description:

A quick go-to dinner. Can be made with almost any meat. I often used ground. Works perfect for lettuce wraps. Try replacing the onion with thinly sliced fennel.

Optional: spice this thing up, with a dose of your favorite chili paste/sauce.

# Ingredients:

* vegetable oil
* 1⁄2 teaspoon ginger
* 1 tablespoon garlic
* 1⁄2 cup soy sauce
* 1⁄2 cup water
* 3⁄4 cup dark brown sugar
* 1 lb flank steak
* 1 yellow onion
* 2 large green onions

# Steps:

1. Slice the beef thin and cook with a bit of oil (your choice) and the yellow onion (cut into petals) in a medium saucepan. Set aside when done.
2. Make the sauce by heating 2 tsp of vegetable oil over med/low heat in the same pan. Don’t get the oil too hot.
3. Add ginger and garlic to the pan and quickly add the soy sauce and water before the garlic scorches.
4. Dissolve the brown sugar in the sauce, then raise the heat to medium and boil the sauce for 2-3 minutes or until the sauce thickens.
5. Remove from the heat, add beef back in. Toss
6. Serve with rice, top with green onions
