# Description

Pork is called “the other white meat”, but this sous vide technique is so dang good I’m gonna graduate it up to “THE white meat”.

# Ingredients

* pork shoulder (or other cheap cut)
* immerison circulator (we like the Anova)

# Steps

1. Sous vide the pork at 140° for 24h
2. Submerge bag into an ice bath to completely cool
3. Cut and portion the cold roast into individual steaks
4. Seal and save (fridge for 3 days, freezer for longer)
5. To serve, reheat in bag, sear in sourching hot pan
