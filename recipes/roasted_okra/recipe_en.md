# Description

I love me some okra, but prep is usually enough to avoid making it. This simple dish requires only a single cut per pod and a dash of seasoning- thatâ€™s it.

# Ingredients

* 1 bunch of okra
* salt, pepper, etc to taste

# Steps

1. Wash the okra dang good
2. Slice in half lengthwise
3. Toss okra and seasoning on baking sheet (salt + pepper is great, I also really like Simply Asia spicy hibachi seasoing I found at HEB for like $2)
4. Roast under the broiler for 10-15 mins. Keep an eye on it and pull it when the tips start to blacken.
