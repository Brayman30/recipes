# Description:

A lot of places are doing dang good brussels lately, but none can touch [Salty Sow](http://saltysow.com/). They serve them fried, topped with pecorino and golden raisins. Yes, please.

We started trying to emulate it, but it’s such a versatile dish, you can make it however you want. Consider this a loose guide.

# Ingredients:

* 1 bunch of brussels, sliced thin
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* salt, pepper, etc to taste

* (optional) grated hard cheese
* (optional) gold raisins or sweetened cranberries
* (optional) assorted veggies, sliced thin

# Steps:

1. Wash and thinly slice the brussels sprouts (or buy them pre-sliced at HEB or Central Market)
2. Toss the brussels (+ optional veggies), olive oil, and salt + pepper on a baking sheet
3. Roast under the broiler for 10-15 mins, keeping a close eye
4. Remove from the oven when the edges just start to blacken
5. Toss with optional ingredients (depending on how healthy you’re feeling)
